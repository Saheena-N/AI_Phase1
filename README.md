# AI_Phase1_Eathquake_Prediction_Model
# Introduction

             Creating an earthquake prediction model is a complex and challenging task, since there is no foolproof method for predicting earthquakes with high accuracy. However, you can build a basic earthquake prediction model using Python by analyzing historical earthquake dataset.

# Dataset

            The dataset for this project is stored in the file earthquake.csv . This dataset contains the past historical earthquake events which are occured based on their criterias of longitude, latitude, depth, depth error, length, type, magnitude etc.

# Data exploration

Before going into the earthquake prediction model using python let us obtain the historical data as reliable source from Earthquake catalog

        - Clean the data by handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns
        - Convert date-time columns to the appropriate data type
        - Calculate basic statistics and visualizations to understand the data.
        - Evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or accuracy, depending on your chosen model
        - Use the trained model to make earthquake predictions based on new data.

# Database
       
       Get the dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/earthquake-database

# Required Tools
        
        - Python 3.x
        - Required python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, scikit-learn

# Installation
